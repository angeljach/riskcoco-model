A marker of good quality risk statement is that it can answer the following questions:
* What could happen?
* Why could it happen?
* Why do we care?


Definitions:
* Risk: Effect of uncertainty on objectives.
* Effect: Deviation from the expected.
* Uncertainty: State, even partial, of deficiency of information related to understanding or knowledge of an event, it's consequence, or likelihood.
* Event: Occurrence or change of a particular set of circumstances and can have several causes. An event must have an effect on objectives.
* Cause: Is that which gives rise to any action, phenomenon or condition.
* Consequence: Outcome of an event affecting objectives.
* Likelihood: Change of something happening; risk is a combination of potential events and consequences along with the associated likelihood of ocurrence. If the risk factor is 100% certain to happen, this is not a risk, but an issue. If the risk factor is impossible, it is irrelevant.


Risk Statement: Looks like one of those:
* [Event that has an effect on objectives] caused by [cause/s] resulting in [consequence/s].
* [Event that has an effect on objectives] caused by [cause/s]. This may result in [consequence/s]
Examples:
* Customer data leakage, corruption or unavailability caused by defective system changes resulting in financial fraud losses of 1 million and ICO fine of 500k, customer churn of 6.4 %, and regulatory sanction by the Prudential Regulation Authority.
* Loss of market share caused by eroded customer confidence in the organisation's information security resulting in net revenue reduction of 200k and bank share value reduced by 12%.

If risk exceed the risk tolerance level, then we need to implement a risk response.

Risk Response:
1. Avoid
2. Reduce/Mitigate
3. Share/Transfer
4. Accept

Parameters for Risk Response Selection
* Cost of Response to Reduce RIsk Within Tolerance Levels.
* Importance of Risk.
* Capability to Implement Response.
* Effectiveness of Response.
* Efficiency of the Response.

Then we need to prioritise risk response options.

Finally, create a risk action plan.
